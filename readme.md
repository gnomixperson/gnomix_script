# README FOR GNOMIX CUSTOMIZATION SCRIPT AND ASSOCIATED APPS:

Gnomix is an independent project developed by a so far small group of people (primarily me, that is, gnomixperson AKA icebearunreal & banyatforwork-blip AKA chichbo)
It includes a customization script

### What's the script do?
There are 2 versions: TUI and GUI. 
Both accomplish the same task of course, by customizing your ubuntu setup.
